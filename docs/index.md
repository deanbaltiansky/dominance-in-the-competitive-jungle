# Introduction

<p>
Why do some people behave dominantly, regularly using threats, coercion, and aggression, whereas others seem to avoid such behavior? Different traditions of scholarship have offered a wide variety of explanations, ranging from biological models, to clinical and personality accounts, to social and situational explanations of behavior. We posit that actors' *beliefs* about relationship consequences to their behavior. In the background, we argue, are people's competitive worldview; a view of the social world as a constant battle for status and resources. Specifically, we posit that those who believe that the world is a competitive jungle believe that dominant behavior is forgivable, unobjectionable, and socially acceptable. In turn, this belief drives their tendency to exert influence through threat, coercion, and intimidation. The explanation of relationship expectancies, we propose, will explain the relationship between competitive worldview over and above compliance expectancies (i.e., maybe those with a competitive worldview just believe dominance is more effective and therefore behavior more dominantly) and relationship motivations (i.e., maybe those with a competitive worldview just don't care about relationships and therefore behave more dominantly). Ultimately, we propose that a *mis-estimation* of relationship outcomes drives behavior.

# Summary

<p>
We test this claim in five complementary preregistered studies. In Study 1 (N = 275), part- and full-time employees completed a battery of well-established scales of dominance and worldviews, providing internal and discriminant validity for our claims, over and above alternative explanations of dominance. In Study 2 (N = 289), participants estimated the relationship impact of employee-recounted real-world managerial dominance, indicated their behavioral intentions in those scenarios, and completed a measure of competitive worldview, providing external validity for our claims. In Studies 3A and 3B (N = 1,192), participants role-played as managers and employees in an incentive-compatible paradigm, providing behavioral evidence for our claims. In Study 4 (N = 492), manager-playing participants who were randomly assigned to reflect on the positive, as opposed to negative, relationship impact of dominance consequently behaved more dominantly toward an ostensible employee, providing experimental evidence for the causal effect of relationship expectancies on dominant behavior. Overall, this research provides the first evidence that competitive worldview predicts relationship expectancies which, in turn, shape dominant strategies and behavior.
